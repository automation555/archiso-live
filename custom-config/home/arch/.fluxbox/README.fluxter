This file gives a short description of the configuration possibilities of
fluxter.

** Configuring fluxter **
------------------------

Blackbox users:

By default fluxter reads the Blackbox style-file as defined in .blackboxrc 
and copies as much of the style as possible. The result is a application 
which looks a lot like the toolbar. 

Configuration options can be changed in fluxter.bb. 
Most likely you want to change some of these options, 

The global configuration file can be found in $datadir/fluxbox/fluxter.bb
A local configuration can be made by copying the fluxter.bb file to 
$HOME/.fluxbox/fluxter.bb and editing it.


Users other Window managers:

Configuration options can be changed in fluxter.bb. 
Most likely you want to change some of these options, 

The global configuration file can be found in $datadir/fluxbox/fluxter.nobb
A local configuration can be made by copying the fluxter.nobb file to 
$HOME/.fluxbox/fluxter.nobb and editing it.


** Reconfigure fluxter.**
------------------------

Automatic update style:
	If the resource : fluxter.autoConfig: true
	The tool will periodically check if the main config files, .blackboxrc
	for Blackbox users and fluxter.nobb for other WM's to see if 
	they have changed. If so fluxter will reconfigure.


** Copying the look of the Blackbox toolbar **
----------------------------------------------
fluxter automaticly copes the style of the blackbox toolbar.
It copies:
toolbar                	 	-> fluxter.frame
toolbar.label           	-> fluxter.label
toolbar.color           	-> fluxter.frame.color
toolbar.colorTo         	-> fluxter.frame.colorTo
toolbar.label.color     	-> fluxter.label.color
toolbar.label.colorTo   	-> fluxter.label.colorTo
toolbar.textColor       	-> fluxter..textColor
bevelWidth              	-> fluxter.bevelWidth

For the meaning of the different resources see the comments in the
config-files.
