Chakra (Alpha4 - NewAge)

Today we're pleased to announce the release of Alpha4 named NewAge of our very own Chakra LiveMedias. Lot's had changed since Alpha3. We have a new KDE4 Theme by Phil Miller, Tribe can install custom mountpoints and we did a ton of fixes. KDEmod got updated to version 4.3.3. Chakra-Hardware-Detection got stripped down to fit xorg-server 1.7.1.901-2 pkg, so only nvidia drivers are the supported propertary drivers for now. On the DVD-Release we have all your goodies on.

Please test this release wherever possible, and most of all, on real hardware. Report bugs, or even better send us patches and share your ideas. The place where all of this happens is our Bugtracker, please be sure to register on it. Also check our Wiki, a lot of questions are already answered. Thx flies out to our developers and the Chakra TestSquad who tested this image.

With love,
The Chakra Team
