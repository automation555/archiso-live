- changes: boot option to save everything persistent. 
  	   Only works on usb/hd if its ext2 format.

- from: to boot from a folder on hard drive or usb stick. This makes it look
	neat on the usb/hd and you can have more then one 
	version of archiso-live on it.

- bootusb: This is so you boot on hard drive or usb stick. Otherwise
	   it thinks its on a livecd. Need for changes to work.

- aufs: This a boot option for aufs. Otherwise it uses unionfs. 
	NOTE: Best to have this on all the time. Unionfs is just a fail safe
	if aufs doesn't work.

- session: This is so you can select a desktop to boot up into on startup.
	   Desktops to select: lxde, xfce, kde, gnome, fluxbox, awesome, icewm
